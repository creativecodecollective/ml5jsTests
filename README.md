# ml5jsTests  
  
based on <a href="https://ml5js.org/docs/yolo-webcam">ml5.js example</a> but without using other javascript libraries like p5.js  

## setup  

you will need to run a local server to use this without hosting it online.   
this is easy to do from the terminal!  

do you already have node.js with npm package manager installed?
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">install it here</a>
  
using node/npm, enter the following in the terminal:
$ `cd PATH/TO/WHERE/YOU/SAVED/THIS`  
$ `sudo npm install http-server -g`  
$ `http-server`  
visit the address that loads  

Note: in this version, index.html contains all the JS but could also be separated into another file. It also has been stripped of P5.js and other dependencies.
