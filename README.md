# ml5jsTests  
  
based on <a href="https://ml5js.org/docs/yolo-webcam">ml5.js example</a> but without using other javascript libraries like p5.js  

## file info  

## setup  
  
you will need to run a local server to use this without hosting it online.   
this is easy to do from the terminal!  

using python (v3), with pip package manager:   
$ `pip install http.server`  
$ `python -m http.server`  
  
using node (javascript for outside the browser), with npm package manager:   
$ `npm install http-server`  
$ `http-server`  
  
index.html contains all the js here but could also be separated into another file
